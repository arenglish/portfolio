<h1>31_dsPIC Programming Initialization</h1>
<div>Since our sPIC33 micro-controller has not yet been setup in a breakout dev board, I tried to get sample code running on a spare PIC16 left over from previous projects.  I was able to successfully build a program and confirm connections between the PIC and its programming device, but the PIC16 responds unexpectedly to the programmer when it attempts to download to the PIC.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I searched in forums about the specific problem, and three primary causes were mentioned.  (a) the Pickit 3 programmer communication wires were connected improperly, (b) Picket 3 power and comm. lines needed bypass capacitors, (c) device was faulty.  After confirming (a) and (b) were not the problem, I decided to move on to testing other areas of the Electrical system until our dsPIC33 could be used. </div>

<div>However, I could also begin a pseudo program for the dsPIC, specifically working out the details of safety fallbacks in the program.</div>

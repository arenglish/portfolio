<div>We met today to finalize our Governor’s Cup presentation slides, practice the presentation with ourselves, and practice one more time before Frazier &amp; Friends.  This week, we have the Governor’s Cup Competition on Thursday in Little Rock.  </div>

<div>Throughout all of our practice presentations, feedback has mainly consisted of requests to improve enthusiasm for the project and to speak slower.  We have all improved on this and are getting better overtime we practice.  We have also learned how to present the engineering aspect of the project with a business audience in mind, knowing when to use big engineering words to go over their heads and when to use terms the audience can understand.</div>

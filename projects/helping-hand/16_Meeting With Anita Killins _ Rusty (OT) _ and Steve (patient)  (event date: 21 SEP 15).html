<h1>16_Meeting With Anita Killins / Rusty (OT) / and Steve (patient)  (event date: 21 SEP 15)</h1>
<div>Anita was able to schedule a meeting with occupational therapist Rusty and stroke patient Steve for our group.  We wanted to meet with an OT in order to understand the everyday complications of working with stroke patients and other rehabilitated people who needed some form of assistance in recovering arm and hand function.  Steve is a stroke victim who has mostly recovered from his stroke (did not happen too recently), but still has problems with muscle tension in his left hand and arm.  We wanted to meet with a stroke patient to better understand how high muscle tone interrupted normal hand usage and to ask about other basic patient needs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Rusty</b>:  Rusty provided a very helpful perspective to the meeting with realistic considerations and experiences.  He mentioned that a device which could successfully assist a patient in opening their hand and using it could be overshadowed by the patient’s lack of arm use.  For example, a patient may be able to use the device to help them hold a drink in their hand, but with their arm hanging limp (or contracted) the hand assistance will not be useful considering that the hand is going to be swinging around with the uncontrollable arm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It was mentioned that during his early recovery period, Steve had fair control over his arm.  Instead his hand was the problem, as he would have to continuously work to forcibly keep it open whenever needing to use it for weight bearing or carrying objects.  In this case, a hand-assistive device would be beneficial.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Rusty also said that a device that required too much interaction of the patient’s good arm in order to operate practically wouldn’t be used.  Stroke patients rely heavily on their unaffected side to perform tasks that they can no longer use both hands or arms for.  Occupying the good arm/hand too continuously would be detrimental to the purpose of the device.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Steve:</b>  Steve discussed some of the difficulties involved with regaining muscle control after his stroke.  He mentioned that immediately after his stroke, he had lost control his left arm and hand.  He quickly began to recover muscle control, but by the time this control began to return, his muscles had already began developing muscle tone. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>He said that his arm was not as difficult to use normally, but his hand, as with many stroke patients, would curl into a fist whenever he was not using it.  This would require him to tediously open his hand, one finger at a time, normally pressing his opening hand against a table top to keep it open during the process.  After this he could use his hand for a particular function such as carrying a box, or bearing his weight (maybe for standing-to-sitting motion).  However, keeping his hand open in a desired position required most of his focus during the task.  As soon as he would divert focus to some other aspect of the task, his hand would lose control and go limp.  This was a very big hassle particularly for jobs such as carrying groceries or buckets.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>He mentioned that at times he wished he could simply have his hand open to just one position (similar to splinting) to prevent from having to constantly manually open it.  This would also eliminate the problem of losing control in his hand as soon as his focus was diverted.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Anita:</b>  Anita talked about the importance of the patient being able to remove a device quickly if they began to experience pain or uncomforted from its assistance.  This prompted Rusty’s next part of the discussion.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Rusty:</b>  Rusty warned that a complex device using motors, cables, and active forces would very likely deter patients from using it.  He talked about how patients might be uneasy about a device that pulled back on their fingers, uncertain of when it would stop applying force.  Of course, we have considered this as part of the safety of our design (that it does not have the ability to force a patient’s fingers or hand out of their range of motion).  But he offered a device concept that would allow patients to manually mold their hand to the shape that they wanted to use it in.  The device would not  be actively pulling or pushing on their fingers, just resisting the muscle tone and preventing unwanted limp hand problems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>He compared it to a ratcheting system that can be clicked into certain positions and locked along the way if desired.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Anita:</b> In discussing how to differentiate between unwanted muscle contracture and normal muscle movements, Anita said that unwanted muscle contracture will normally happen simultaneously in the wrist and fingers, while normal independent muscle movements are not as often both contractions at the same time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Steve:</b> Steve offered to demonstrate how muscle tone in his left hand still affected him.  Patrick held his arm out horizontally for Steve to grasp.  As Steve closed his hand around Patrick’s arm, his hand appeared to function almost normally until muscle tone began to tighten the grasp on Patrick’s arm.  It seemed like muscle tone was causing any grasping functions to be over-exaggerated and therefore difficult to perform precisely.  When Steve tried to pick up a pen, he was successful, but it took a great deal of focus to keep his fingers under control as he grasped the pen with his fingertips.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The discussion mainly ended with Rusty emphasizing the benefit of simplicity in the device.  He also mentioned the thermoplastic materials that he and his colleagues use to make temporary splints for patients.  The plastics can be heated and molded to a patient’s arm form, but the material is expensive.</div>

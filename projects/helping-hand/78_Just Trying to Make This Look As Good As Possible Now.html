<h1>78_Just Trying to Make This Look As Good As Possible Now</h1>
<div>Without the Motor Control and Processing PCB’s, the electrical control system was no longer able to fit inside the forearm housing unit.  Fortunately, the Power Distribution Board worked out okay and was able to be placed inside the battery box (<i><b>Figure 1</b></i>) on top of the lithium batteries (<i><b>Figure 2</b></i>).</div>

<div>Also, the LED Indicator Board was still working fine, so it was able to be placed inside the forearm housing box along with the user I/O buttons (<i><b>Figure 3</b></i>).</div>

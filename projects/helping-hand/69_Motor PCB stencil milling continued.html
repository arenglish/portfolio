<h1>69_Motor PCB stencil milling continued</h1>
<div>Talking to Doug about the problem I had with the stencils, I found out about OSH-Stencils, a company that will create stencils based off of PCB designs that you upload to their website.  I decided to do this instead as it was fairly cheap and would be easier.  Doug had a lot of other things to say as well.</div>

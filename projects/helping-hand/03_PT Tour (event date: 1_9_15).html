<div>Context: My group (and other BME) was given a tour/review of Harding PT school's equipment, facilities, and recovery devices.    Physical therapist Anita Killens showed us around the facilities and gave useful insight on patient/trainer experiences with the current devices and equipment as well as aspects of the current technology that could be improved.</div>

<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Helpful Ideas Anita and groups brainstormed:</strong></span></div>
<div>Hand plant/weight shift device</div>
<div>Finger tensioner/extender; forearm equivalent</div>
<div>Shoulder assist</div>
<div>Scoliosis back support/breathing ability</div>
<div>Leg splint with on/off capability</div>
<div>Sit-to-stand back corrector: not leaning forward far enough: "nose-to-toes"</div>
<div><br clear="none"/></div>
<div>With tensioner devices, Anita expressed the importance of having a balance of patient independence and device assistance.  Too much device assistance results in muscle/limb degradation.</div>

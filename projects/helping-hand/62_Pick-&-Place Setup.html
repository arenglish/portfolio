<div>To place parts on the Motor Control and Processing PCB’s I would have to use the Pick-&amp;-Place.  Many of the parts for these boards are microscopic and the PIC has 100 pins that would be hard to line up by hand.</div>

<div>I started trying to setup files with the Pick-&amp;-Place tonight with Josh Donaway’s help.  He had used it before to place some of their parts.  I was only able to load a blank work file though, and did not manage to get part centroids loaded into the machine’s software.</div>

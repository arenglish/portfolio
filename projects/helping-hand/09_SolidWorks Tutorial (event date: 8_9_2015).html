<div>On Tuesday evening at 7:00pm, Dr. Wells hosted a SolidWorks training tutorial for SolidWorks. Taylor Williams recommended the session to us, considering that none of us had had rigorous SolidWorks training as the ME’s do.  We agreed that SolidWorks would be very useful in designing our product, especially considering that any physical simulations we perform may not mimic the human hand as accurately as we may be able to in SolidWorks.</div>

<div>On Tuesday night, Patrick, Devin, and I went to Dr. Well’s SolidWorks session and successfully designed a disk brake, learning some of the basics of SolidWorks part design.  We plan on attending the Thursday night session as well with Chris to get some more experience. </div>

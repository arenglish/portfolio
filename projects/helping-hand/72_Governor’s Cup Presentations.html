<div>It turned out Chris wasn’t able to make it to the competition.  The rains flooded Searcy, and he wasn’t able to make it Wednesday night.  Thursday morning, he left early to make it to the competition, but had a wreck on the way there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Devin and Patrick  have been preparing to take over his part in the presentation.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We practiced several times Thursday morning before the presentation, then presented at 2:30 I think.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The presentation couldn’t have been more perfect.  Everyone’s parts in the presentation went smoothly, and we answered all the questions properly.  The judges didn’t have much feedback though, which was a bad sign.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Later Thursday night, the top six contestants were announced with none of Harding’s teams making it.</div>

<div>Our group reviewed the components of our A3 report which each team member had composed and refined the report slide.</div>
<div>Additionally, we conducted a preliminary finger-tension test using some string, a pulley, and weights.  To perform the test, a string was attached on one end to a weight hanger in free air and the other end to a participant’s finger.  The participant laid their hand out palm-up on the table-top, and the weight was hung off the side of the table, being routed through a pully at the edge of the desk.  Each finger, excluding the thumb, was tested by adding weight to the hanger until the finger extended to a position that we considered to be the minimum position needed for an extended finger (Figure A).  All of the tests are summarized in Figure A with Fingers 1-4 being the index finger through the “pinky” respectively.</div>

<div>In order to place parts on the final PCB’s, a stencil has to be made.  The stencil allows us to spread solder paste onto the PCB’s pads, as doing it by hand for small parts does not normally work well.</div>

<div>Plybon helped me through the process of creating a solder-stencil with the S63, however, I was not able to get it to create a precise enough stencil.  I think it was a problem similar to what was happening with the pads on the processing board being milled out too thin, except it was difficult to fix it for the stencil’s material.  <i><b>Figure 1</b></i> shows one of the attempts to create the solder stencil.  Most of the pads ended up being connected to each other on the stencil, which would possibly cause the pads to short after paste was applied with them.</div>

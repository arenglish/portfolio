<h1>50_SPI Demonstration</h1>
<div>After completing the SPI setup between the external ADC and the PIC33, I used the converted signal to drive a motor control circuit.  Using the received analog signal, I had the PIC to output a PWM signal to the motor driver circuit that was proportional to the analog value.  Using a potentiometer to adjust the analog value sent to the ADC, the speed of the motor was able to be controlled as the potentiometer was adjusted.</div>

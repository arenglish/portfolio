<div>None of Harding’s teams made it to the top six contestants in the Governor’s Cup Competition. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We were all mostly okay with it, but the look of defeat on Frazier’s face after hearing the top six announced was enough to make us feel sad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The theory is that Harding’s teams may not have been selected at least partially because they were all health/safety related projects.  It’s not hard to see why judges would not want a health/safety product representing Arkansas in tri-state finals.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This theory is bolstered when considering that the top six teams were fairly Arkansas themed.  A sports cooler with wheels, an agricultural bedding made out of chicken feathers, a “wine-finder website”.  And last year Harding’s TIRE team that won was a sort of off-road, country theme as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It turns out that a lot of our Harding team members are going back to Searcy.  I decided to stay with the few others one more night to take advantage of the provided hotel (each night at the Marriott was ~$160).</div>

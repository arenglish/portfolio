<h1>13_Governor’s Cup Business Team Alliance Meeting (event date: 10 SEP 15)</h1>
<div>Our team met at 10:00pm together to discuss our options concerning the Governor’s Cup competition.  Earlier in the day, Chris had interviewed two interested business teams.  We discussed the qualities of teams including the individual team members.  We decided to choose the team led by Sarah Hughes and Jeremy as several of our group members knew them personally and the team had a solid proposal of team composition on their end which would include an accountant.</div>

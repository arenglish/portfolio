<h1>71_Going to Little Rock for Governor’s Cup</h1>
<div>The Helping Hand team has been preparing hard (or is “hardly” the proper grammar?) for the Governor’s Cup competition.  Today, we leave for the big city…. Little Rock.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I drive separately so I can make it back to Searcy on Friday for my Bible seminar in case the others want to stay in Little Rock Friday evening after the competition.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It rained the whole way to Little Rock, surely a bad sign.  When I arrived at the Marriott Hotel, I accidentally drove through some one-way streets before ending up under the parking area in front of the hotel.  Considering that Arkansas Capital was paying for the hotel expenses, I decided to let the valets take my car for $25 a night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After waiting in the lobby for a while, Frazier shows up, and we get checked in.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We decide to walk to a pizza place several blocks from the hotel, forgetting that it was raining heavily.  We made it to the restaurant, but were soaked.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After dinner, we inspected the presentation rooms back at the hotel to figure out our presentation format for the particular rooms.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Later that night, we practiced once more with the business advisors (Frazier &amp; Friends).</div>

<div>Our group met again with Anita at the PT school to talk about preliminary patient needs for relieving the spasticity/hypertonia in the hand.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“How much assistance should a device give to the patient in opening their hand?"</div>
<div>     - <i>Anita emphasized that slow, steady force was necessary to open the hand or other extremities suffering from spasticity.  Forcing an extremity open too fast may break a bone especially if force is applied very far past the natural muscle fulcrum.  Once a hand is opened, very little to almost no force is needed to maintain open position.  Also in patients with more muscle tone problems, the fingers are more likely to curl in more tightly.</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>“What is the process of opening a spastic hand?” </div>
<div>     -<i>Anita said that the procedure for opening a patient’s hand so that they could use it began with straightening their wrist so that the hand is parallel with the forearm.  Then pressing on the two lower palm muscle pads is done to coax the hand open out of a clenched position.  As this is done, the fingers are gently persuaded out to an open position.  </i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>“How long does it take for a patient’s hand to return to a clenched position after opening?"</div>
<div>     - <i>Anita mentioned that muscle tone reclaims a patient’s hand soon after they stop using it.  In other word’s a patient’s hand will return to a clenched position the same as an unaffected person’s hand would return to a resting position after using it (a few seconds).  Keeping the hand open though is somewhat effortless, once the hand has been opened.</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>     - <i>Anita warned about applying force to far out past a muscle’s natural fulcrum point.  Over a person’s lifetime, bone’s natural fulcrum point build’s up strength in that spot.  If for example a pushing force were applied near the wrist in order to extend the arm, the forearm bones could potentially break since the fulcrum (which is structured to more evenly distribute the force) is closer to the elbow.</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div><i>     -</i> <i>Anita also recommended doing research on a product called “DynaSplint” which is a sort of dynamic splint that instead of rigidly conforming a spastic arm applies great force to the arm through a sort of spring(rubber cords) cast system.  She mentioned that this would be a helpful resource for obtaining data needed for designing our device, concerning needed forces and force points.</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>“If we were designing both a hand-spasticity and arm-spasticity device, would it be important which order the hand and arm were assisted in opening?"</div>
<div>     <i>- Anita said that the order of opening the hand and arm would only depend on what activity the patient was undertaking.  For example drinking with the arm closed vs. grabbing a ball with the arm extended.</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>     <i>- She also talked a little about statistics of stroke patient recovery, remarking that patients who are able to have their hands/arms assisted in the opening process are able to exercise them more and eventually regain use of their arms.  Without aid, stroke patients can completely lose functionality in their arms after a period of time due to extreme muscle toning.</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div><i>     -Finally Anita gave us an information sheet regarding grasping positions for the hand (she also gave us a textbook containing hand-anatomy material) and offered to ask one of her patients if he would want to work with us to demonstrate some of the difficulties of dealing with spasticity in his hand.</i><br/></div>

<h1>25_PT Field Trip</h1>
<div>During our System Design Review presentation, Mrs. Killens recommended that we visit the PT school to see some cadavers and get a closer look at the musculoskeletal system in the hand….</div>

<div>This field trip, appropriately timed right before Halloween, was particularly useful to Chris’ EMG Processing designs.  He was able to better understand the locations and functions of particular muscles as they related to the specific hand motions that he was wanting to identify with the device. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also, Patrick benefitted from seeing how the tendons from the arm muscles route on and around the wrist and attach to the fingers.  It was very helpful for him to see where the tendons were anchored on the hand as well.  Anchoring spots are critical in keeping the fingers moving naturally as they are pulled on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I benefitted from this trip as well.  Aside from better understanding how our systems were integrating together, it renewed my confidence in my decision to study engineering over medicine.  Being in a cold chamber with eight dead bodies in stainless steel coffins was eerie.</div>

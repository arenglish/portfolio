<div>Our Sr. Design group first reviewed each individual’s completion of the design matrix for the four potential project topics that were decided upon in the previous in-class meeting.  Based on the criteria points of:</div>
<div><i>(1) ease and necessity of adding an EE component</i></div>
<div><i>(2) importance of safety</i></div>
<div><i>(3) user interaction</i></div>
<div><i>(4) complexity</i></div>
<div><i>(5) innovative</i></div>
<div><i>(6) outside help needed</i></div>
<div><i>(7) budget friendliness</i></div>
<div><i>(8) fun factor</i></div>
<div><i>(9) accessibility of outside guidance</i></div>
<div><i>(10) need </i></div>
<div>the group’s completion of the weighted decision matrix (Fig. A) indicated that the hand tensioner device (proposed by Anita Killens on PT tour) and the prosthetic hand improvement were the best project topics out of the four (hand-tensioner, recovery treadmill, prosthetic hand, autoclave needle sterilizer).  Of the two, the hand-tensioner device came out with an average score higher than the prosthetic hand, and the group tentatively agreed that this was a project we wanted to attempt for our Sr. Design course.</div>

<div>After deciding on our project idea, we wanted to choose our team leader.  First we asked who was interested in the responsibility of team leader.  Devin Benson and Chris Palmore offered their commitment to the position of team leader.  After raising several criteria points for a potential leader, the decision mainly came down to who would potentially be the least burdened by the responsibility (who had the least credit hours/job hours/etc).  We figured that someone with fewer outside responsibilities could be a good leader.  It turned out that Devin had a heavy course load this semester and next semester, while Chris had fewer hours this semester and would have even fewer next semester.  Both members have had great leadership experience in various student organizations, but the whole group agreed that leadership responsibility may be less of a strain on Chris than on Devin, so we chose Chris as our team leader.</div>

<div>We ended our meeting with Devin agreeing to handle submitting our decisions to the professors through Canvas/etc.</div>

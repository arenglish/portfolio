<div>As part of my 1 credit-hour Bible Seminar, SYNC/SWIM (has nothing to do with synchronization or swimming), I had to go the the ZOE concert Friday night.  One may ask, “What does this have to do with engineering?”  As Huff would say, we are not engineers and Christians but are rather Christians who also happen to be engineers...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ZOE is a contemporary acapella worship music group.  They came to Harding Friday night to host what was thought to be a concert.  However, as our Harding Student Association vice president made clear before the event began, “This is not a concert, this is worship.  Stretch out your hands before you as I lead us in prayer before we begin tonight.”  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After this awakening, the Holy Spirit moved through the crowd.  ZOE began reciting cryptic Bible passages to which the crowd miraculously responded in sync with “Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!”  ZOE then continued with some popular church songs, inviting the crowd to sing with them.  Hands rose in holy worship, heads bowed in reflection, and then a hush came over the audience.  The ZOE leader lead us in prayer, proclaiming “The room is pregnant with the awe of God!”  </div>

<div>"Holy, Holy, Holy</div>
<div>Is the Lord God Almighty!</div>
<div>Who was, and is, and is to come!"</div>
